# Puzzle

I created this puzzle to solve a puzzle owned by one of my friends. There are 16 different square shaped pieces with 4 different shapes either coming out or going into the sides. The aim is to make a larger 4 x 4 square by connecting the 16 pieces. 

When the program runs it takes around 3 or 4 minutes to find all of the solutions. It then asks the user which solution they would like to view, displaying the solution with the 16 pieces in the right positions showing the sides that join. 

The pieces and sides have been numbered according to the photo that I have included.
